<center><p style="color:white;"> I did work on a project that would help banks figure out the right clients to give credit cards to. </p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">Also, I will help banks set the perfect credit card balance limit to each client inorder to avoid clients from </p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">getting default. To help illustrating this to the bank, I used dataset from Kaggle.com website. Using this dataset,</p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">I showed the relationship between default payment and some clients characteristics such as age, education, marriage,</p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">etc.. I tested using different regression models to see whihc one will give most accurate result. In the link below,</p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"> you will see all my analysis and testings. </p></center>

<center><p style="color:white;">In one of my courses, I worked with colleagues on figuring out if mask mandate lower the number of COVID-19 cases. </p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">The states we used to do the testing are Indiana and Florida, the data regards both states were obtained from New York </p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">Times. Also, we included past experiements that were done using different regression models (than different in different model). </p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">Using the difference in difference model, we were able to find out that mask mandates help in lowering number of COVID-19 cases.</p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">In the link below, you will see the difference in difference regression model codes and analysis.</p></center>
